# Machine Learning Project: Model Training, Evaluation, and Deployment

## Overview
This project involves data manipulation, visualization, machine learning model training, and deployment. We use Python libraries to explore, train, evaluate, and deploy predictive models for a given dataset.
This repository features a comprehensive machine learning project focused on data cleaning, E, model training, and deployment using Flask. The project includes building a Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and Neural Network to predict outcomes from a given dataset, highlighting model deployment capabilities through a API.
## Key Steps
1. **Import Libraries and Load Data**: Import necessary Python libraries (`pandas`, `numpy`, etc.) and load the dataset.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Handle missing values and preprocess data for modeling.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyze the dataset visually to identify patterns and relationships.
4. **Model Training**: Train machine learning models like Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and Neural Networks.
5. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the performance using metrics such as accuracy, F1-score, ROC-AUC.
6. **Model Deployment**: Deploy the model using Flask for real-time predictions.

## Technologies Used
- **Languages**: Python
- **Libraries**: `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `xgboost`, `Flask`, `shap`

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required libraries using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the Jupyter notebook for data analysis and model training.
4. Use the Flask API to deploy and test the model predictions in real-time.

## Conclusion
The project showcases end-to-end machine learning workflow including model training and deployment, highlighting important skills in data science and Python development.
